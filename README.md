A data analysis using concepts from Big Data analytics and Exploratory Data Analysis on earthquake dataset of India acquired from Kaggle 

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to Analyzing trends in earthquake frequency and magnitude over time

## Dataset(s) Used

The Earthquakes - Indian Subcontinent dataset on Kaggle is a collection of data on earthquake events that have occurred in the Indian subcontinent from 18 years. It includes information such as the date, time, and location of each earthquake, as well as its magnitude. The dataset was compiled by gathering data from various sources, including seismic monitoring networks and scientific publications.

## Team Members

- Rahavi S, Poojitha P, RAJASEKAR M, SAKTHI KUMAR V

## Key Findings

In the course of this project, we have successfully identified and predicted the occurrence of the next transit event using the available transit finder data. This outcome represents a significant milestone in exoplanetary research, as it provides astronomers with valuable insights into exoplanetary behavior and transit patterns.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

This project has demonstrated the feasibility of predicting future transits efficiently. As the next steps, we recommend:

- Refining the predictive model to enhance accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset to include a wider range of exoplanets for more comprehensive analysis.
- Developing user-friendly tools or applications that astronomers can use to plan their observation schedules based on transit predictions.

We believe that these steps will contribute to the advancement of exoplanetary research and our understanding of exoplanets' behavior through predictive modeling.
